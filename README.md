## 1. Exact F2 algorithm
On Local Machine:
Exact F2. Time Elapsed: 86s. Estimate: 8567966130

## 2. Tug of War Algorithm
On Local Machine:
Tug-of-War F2 Approximation. Width: 10. Depth: 3. Time elapsed:149s. Estimate: 358504512.

## 4.
Running Tug of War with width 10 and depth 3 resulted in a running time a little less than double that of running exact f2. However, running tug of war with depth and width equal to 1 resulted in a running time of 32 seconds, much faster than the exact f2. Exact F0 took 69 seconds to run.
